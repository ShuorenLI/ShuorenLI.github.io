- May 11th, I attended ACS on Campus and went to University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) to listen to Prof. Shu Wang's presentation (Executive Editor of ACS Applied Bio Materials) and to get a better understanding of CAS Finder. The final face-to-face meeting with the editors-in-chief was also very beneficial, with Prof Liu Shiyong, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of Chemistry of Materials, and Academician Tian He, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, taking part in the seminar.
